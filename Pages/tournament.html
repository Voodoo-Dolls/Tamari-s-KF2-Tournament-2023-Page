            <h2>TOURNAMENT INFO</h2>
            <p>This is a tournament for KILLING FLOOR 2 centered around the Controlled Difficulty mod -- a mod which allows for fine tuning of difficulty-specific game variables and obtaining a level of consistency and intensity that drives a team experience simply not available in the vanilla game.</p><br>
            <p>In this tournament, experienced players (Mentors) take on a group comprised of newer or lesser-experienced players, show them the ropes, and attempt to earn the most Points they can in each match!</p><br>
            <p>The ultimate goal of this tournament is not only to unite the community, but to give players (especially newer ones) the opportunity to learn and grow alongside experienced players in mechanical skill, game knowledge, and confidence in a (friendly) competitive environment where there is no fear of being judged. If nothing else, the primary goal is to have FUN and make friends together!</p><br>
            <p>This tournament is hosted by Tamari, Forrest Mark X, and the Tamari's KF2 Community and is (hopefully) one of many to come. We hope everyone who plays comes out on the other end with a whole lot of game knowledge and maybe even some new friends to go with it!

            <h2>WHAT'S A "MENTOR TOURNAMENT"?</h2>
            <p>A Mentor Tournament involves an experienced player (a Mentor) taking on a group of newer or lesser-experienced players, showing them the ropes, and competing against other Mentor-led teams to see who can perform the best in a given match!

            <h2>PRIZES?</h2>
            <p>We are currently working on preparing a prize pool for the tournament. More to come later!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>CAPACITY</h2>
            <p>The tournament has enough space for 42 Players.</p><br>
            <p>After we have reached capacity, all subsequent signups will be placed on a waiting list to enter the tournament in the event space becomes available.</p><br>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>WHEN DOES IT START?</h2>
            <p>The tournament starts on Monday, July 3rd, 2023 and ends no later than Monday, September 18, 2023</p><br>
            <p>Keep in mind that not all teams will make it to the end, due to eliminations. So therefore, only a fraction of the total players will end up playing for the full duration of the event.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>GAME SETTINGS</h2>
            <p>All matches in this tournament will be played on 10-Wave Survival Mode on Hell on Earth difficulty using the Controlled Difficulty mod.</p><br>
            <p>Matches played in this tournament will be harder than a typical vanilla Hell on Earth match, however not so difficult that an exemplary level of skill will be required. For example, there will be more Large ZEDs present than in a typical vanilla HoE game and teams will need to coordinate, communicate, and effectively use their combined resources to tackle the waves. In the end, this is more about how well you can work together as a team, not how good your mechanical skills are.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>FORMAT</h2>
            <p>An open Group Stage for the first three weeks, leading into a seeded (via results from the Group Stage) Double Elimination bracket for the Playoffs.
            </p><br>
            <p>The goal of each match is to earn the highest number of Points, which are earned through a unique scoring system created specifically for this tournament. The better your team performs, the more points you earn! In the Playoffs rounds, earning a higher score than the enemy team will win you the match and allow you to advance to the next round.
            </p>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h2>ANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS?</h2>
            <h3>A small level of commitment is minimally required to participate in this tournament.</h3>
            <p>Playing in this tournament is NOT meant to be a full time job, however you will still be expected to be there for your team and be able to commit a reasonable amount of time in a given week to practice, coordinate, and ensure your team's best chances of succeeding in each match.
            </p><br>
            <p>Just because you have a full time job doesn't mean you aren't allowed to play in this tournament. We're simply asking for players to be willing to commit a small amount of time (within reason) to their teams.
            </p><br>
            <h3>Only players on the STEAM platform can sign up for this tournament.</h3>
            <p>Most of our underlying systems and servers depend on the player having a valid STEAMID64, and as such, it is not possible for us at this time to support players playing on the Epic Games platform. You will need a copy of the game on STEAM to be able to register and play.
            </p><br>
            <p>We're very sorry about this and hope to be able to accommodate Epic players in the future!
            </p><br>
            <h3>Teams are filled via a draft selection in this tournament.</h3>
            <p>In a draft selection, team captains take turns selecting players until all players have been chosen. To aid in producing balanced teams, all players will be placed into Experience Groups that denote a player's relative experience within CD.</p><br>
            <p>This means that there is a (slight) chance that you may not get to play with your friends.</p><br>

            <h3>This is an international tournament.
            </h3>
            <p>Players from all regions are welcome to participate in this tournament, provided they meet the minimum criteria (outlined above). By signing up to play, ALL competitors are expected to understand that their teammates AND opponents may be based in a distant time zone, which means that some or all players in a team may be required to play at inopportune / abnormal times throughout the day.
            </p><br>

            <p>Furthermore, ping may be a factor depending on where you are located in the world. There will be servers offered for matches in many of the major regions of the world, but pings within a team may differ due to the draft selection.
            </p>

        <p>If you are a new player who is not currently a part of our community, you will be required to participate in a few mock matches so we can get to know you and you will be subject to a Staff evaluation to determine if you're a good fit for the tournament. Don't stress about this too much. At the end of the day, if you're a friendly person who is eager to learn more about the game and is willing to commit a reasonable amount of time, it is very unlikely that you will be rejected!
        </p><br>
        <p>So while you wait for the tournament to begin, come hang out with us on the tournament discord and join some games!</p>
        <p>We'll be hosting many in the weeks leading up to the start of the event and it'll be a great way for you to meet the captains, get to know some of your potential teammates, and get an introduction to CD!
