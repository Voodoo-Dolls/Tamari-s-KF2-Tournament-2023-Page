                <h2>Welcome to the Tamari's KF2 Summer Showdown 2023 CD Tournament!</h2>
                <br>
                <p>This is a tournament for KILLING FLOOR 2 centered around the Controlled Difficulty mod -- a mod which allows for fine tuning of difficulty-specific game variables and obtaining a level of consistency and intensity that drives a team experience simply not available in the vanilla game.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The objective of this tournament is not only to unite the community, but to give players (especially newer ones) the opportunity to learn and grow alongside experienced players in mechanical skill, game knowledge, and confidence in a (friendly) competitive environment where there is no fear of being judged. If nothing else, the primary goal is to have FUN and make friends together!</p>
                <br>
                <p>This tournament is hosted by Tamari, Forrest Mark X, and the Tamari's KF2 Community and is (hopefully) one of many to come. There is no prize for winning, other than bragging rights, a whole lot of game knowledge, and maybe even some new friends to go with it!</p>

                <h2>Tamari's KF2</h2>
                <p>
                    Tamari's KF2 is the result of the combined efforts of Tamari & Forrest Mark X to bring a modded experience to KF2 that refreshes the experience and enhances the game through quality-of-life features and changes, new gamemodes, and a chill and close-knit environment. We're a multi-continental KF2 community with over 29 servers supporting the NA and EU regions, and now also Southeast Asia / Australia as well!
                </p>

                <h2>Our Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily to introduce people to higher levels of play (Controlled Difficulty), but the main objective above all else is FUN. We don't like drama and try our best to maintain a stress-free environment that feels more like a small gaming family than a group of friends playing games together.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Like playing standard Endless and Survival? We have something for that.</p>
                <p>Like playing at difficulties harder than HoE? We have something for that.</p>
                <p>Like playing custom, wacky, new modes? We have something for that as well.</p>
                <p>There is something for everyone here and players of all types are welcome!</p>
                <br>
                <p>These are not your typical modded servers. The mods in use aim to enhance the vanilla experience as opposed to drastically changing it. As such, you can expect to find features that remedy some of the more clunky aspects of vanilla KF2 gameplay as well as features that allow players to customize their experience(s).
